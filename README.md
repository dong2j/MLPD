## Summary
This repository consists of two main parts:
1. **Model Selection with Supervised Learning**
2. **Phase Diagram Construction**

The code analyze phase equlibria observations and compute globally optimized phase diagram through multi-class logic regression and supervised learning. the code can be used generalzied but the constrcution of phase relations in Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> at mantel transiton zone conditions is used as bench mark case to ensure reproducibility and ease of use and the data on phase equlibria observations of Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> are provided.
